- Makes BsDoc theme more flexible
- Moves Lunr search JS to core, adds it as an option to BsDoc theme
- Allows themes to be set with custom options for a specific Generator, and improves theme assets handling so the same
    theme with different assets don't overwrite each other
- Sets up Orchid Search to be more contextual. Setting the `searchIndices` with an array of generator keys will restrict
    searches to only from those indices.
- Fixed several other bugs with themes and precompiling
