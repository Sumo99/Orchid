- Creates Taxonomies plugin, which makes it possible to manage custom taxonomies and archives across many plugins. It
    was inspired by and modelled after Hugo's custom taxonomies, but adds its own spin that makes it much more flexible
    and powerful with Orchid's content model.
- Removes the Category and Tag archive pages from the Posts plugin. These archives are now created with the taxonomies
    plugin.
- Adds generation `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` in Core.
- Adds generation of author pages for the Posts plugin. Authors that are set in the config (as before) or that have 
    pages in `posts/authors/` will have pages generated for them. Authors added to individual posts are "guest authors".
