## Bug Fixes

- Fixes broken excerpt function
- Updates FutureImperfect theme to work with new Asset Manager
- Improves asset functions to prevent collisions with AssetRelation assets
- Updates to Kotlin 1.3! And updates other dependencies to match

## Breaking Changes

- Updates to Kotlin 1.3. You may need to update some of your Kotlin code to work properly with 1.3.
- Pebble template syntax for `set` tag has been changed. The identifier must be a plain name, evaluated expressions
    are no longer supported. (e.g. `{% set 'identifier' = 'value' %}` is not longer valid, use 
    `{% set identifier = 'value' %}` instead)
